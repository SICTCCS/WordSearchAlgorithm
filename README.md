# Word Search Algorithm! 
Your objective is to finish out the starter code attached to solve a basic word search puzzle.  
 - This algorithm needs to be designed for ANY size word search.  
 - Need to be able to find words
      - [ ] +3pts horizontally
      - [ ] +5pts vertically
      - [ ] +7pts diagonally
 - Need to be able to find the reversed version of the words i.e. word and drow
      - [ ] +3pts horizontally
      - [ ] +5pts vertically
      - [ ] +7pts diagonally
 - Notify the user of a word found (you will get points for one of these)
      - [ ] +3pts print out the starting location of the 1st letter
      - [ ] +5pts print out the starting location of the 1st letter and the direction it goes in
      - [ ] +7pts save a text file with the same word search, but where either the words are missing or anything that is not a letter in a word is missing
      - [ ] +10pts print to the terminal a "solved" version of the same word search with all words highlighted or font color changed
 - Abstraction is utilized
    - [ ] -10pts  Comment Comment Comment - Trust me, I know what you are capable of, and yes I know what type of algorithms GPT and repl.it AI will produce.  If you are unsure if this code needs comments, do it...  Show me this is your code.
    - [ ] +5pts The program also needs to be able to attempt and find any word given
      - The method on how this works is up to you minus having the user alter the code. More user friendly, the better
    - [ ] +5pts Before any answers are produced, the program needs to display the original word search
    - [ ] +5pts Utilize the original function names and code

### Practice Word Search
You will see an attached board to practice with.  The words are the following:
 - Binary (vert normal)
 - Computers (diagonal downToRight)
 - Hexadecimal (horizontal backwards)
 - Bander (horizontal normal)
 - Powershell (diagonal upToLeft)
 - Apps (vertical backwards)
 - Web Sites (Boggle)
 - Duck (diagonal downToLeft)
 - VSC (diagonal upToRight)
 - Poptarts (vertical normal)

### Bonus Opportunity
 - (+10pts) Boggle Search: The boggle search is where the words do not go in 1 straight line, but they are snaked in the actual puzzle. (Trust me, if you go into computer science in college, you may want to have a working version of this <b>search</b> algorithm.)

### Submission
 - Your solved version of the WordSearch.py <b>BUT</b> please label it as <b>LastNameWordSearch.py</b>
 - A screenshot of your program running
 - Flowcharts of each of the original functions from the WordSearch.py file mentioned below.  These flow charts must follow the CSP Activity 1.1.4 best practices for flow chart documents.  Each line of code should be represented on the Flowchart.  Utilize LucidChart for generating these pdfs. Download the pdfs and save them in this repo in a folder called FlowCharts with each labeled the following naming syntax
